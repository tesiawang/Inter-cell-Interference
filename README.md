# Inter-cell-Interference
Inter-cell Interference Modeling Based on NR Standards

The python script simulates uplink inter-cell interference in SIMO senarios. The receiver beamforming is assumed to be maximal ratio combining with perfect CSI information.

The code is implemented based on Sionna and is aligned with NR standards 3GPP TS38.901.
